Tools Used: Microsoft Excel

Key Insights Gathered:
1. In December 2023, the city's buses carried a whopping 5,654 passengers. But come January 2024, this number dwindled to just 933, marking a dramatic year-over-year decrease of 83.50%. 
2. 2023's data painted the Central Line as the hero of the bus network, bustling with activity, while the South Line remained serene and calm. But as the calendar turned to 2024, the narrative shifted. The East-West Express took the crown as the busiest route, and the North Circular became the tranquil path less traveled.
3. In 2023, the peak moment struck at 6:40 PM, but by 2024, the climax had moved to 9:40 PM. Throughout both years, the city's rhythm pulsed strongest from 6 PM to midnight, highlighting its vibrant nightlife, with the time after dusk accounting for a staggering 64.61% of total passengers.
4. Nearly half (49%) of the buses were well-utilized, meaning they operated at 50% to 100% of their capacity.

Key Recommendations:
1. Expand bus services on high-demand routes to meet passenger needs effectively.
2. Launch targeted marketing initiatives to boost ridership on less utilized routes and enhance overall route awareness.
3. Adjust service schedules to align with peak commuting hours, ensuring efficient and convenient transportation options.
4. Use real-time data analytics to dynamically adjust bus routes and schedules, ensuring optimal coverage and efficiency based on changing passenger trends and route performance.
